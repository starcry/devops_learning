# devops_learning

Engineers learn by doing and whilst getting stuff to do is easy you only really 
learn by doing things for real in the wild. The problem is that a lot of 
assignments I see aren't really designed from problems that engineers face in 
the wild. In this repo I will layout a series of assignments taken from what I 
have faced in the wild.

When it comes to costs, I will try to keep things as cheap as possible but 
staying within the boundaries of some kind of free tier is not my focus, doing 
stuff that you will actually do in the wild is.

Windows vs Linux: I do appreciate that many people prefer Windows Devops 
generally runs Linux, if your not running that locally I suggest you do. A 
Linux VM on virtual box should be fine.

each repo should have a gitignore and should be running precommit
* https://pre-commit.com/
** pre commit allows you to do checks before commiting
** for example you can run terraform fmt to ensure that terraform is correctly
   formatted
